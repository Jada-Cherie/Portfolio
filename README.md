# Portfolio
This is my Web Developer Portfolio that I made to represent myself on a digital platform and to give Employers/Customers a glimpse into the work I have done.

<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

I utilized a Portfolio Template when I made this portfolio. I changed some things in terms of design color in CSS as well as input HTML to better advertise myself.

Lessons Learned:
I learned that when you use premade templates that there is still people using jquery out in these streets. Which probably isn't the best for optimization. I always go back into the work to look at the jquery and would like to go back and change it one day.

Examples:
Here is a link to my portfolio as well as a picture of what it looks like. I've also included a couple of links to my work that are in my profile as well:
